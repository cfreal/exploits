# imagecolormatch() OOB Heap Write exploit

My binary exploit for [CVE-2019-6977](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6977).
Bug found by Simon Scannell from RIPS.

PHP bug is [here](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77270).
Helps you bypass PHP's `disable_functions` INI directive.

I commented *a lot* to help people that are new to binary PHP exploitation. Hope this helps.
